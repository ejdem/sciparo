SCIssors, PAper, ROck!
But even better, who is familiar with TV series "Bing Bang Theory", I hope would enjoy this game.
So, as you can imagine, there are also lizard and spock in the game.
Rules are simple:
Scissors cuts paper.
Scissors decapitates lizard.
Paper covers rock.
Paper disproves spock.
Rock crushes scissors.
Rock cushes lizard.
Lizard eats paper.
Lizard poisons spock.
Spock veporizes rock.
Spock smashes scissors.

Project would contain User, Match and Card classes.
(Card is one of those 5 things you can chose from).
